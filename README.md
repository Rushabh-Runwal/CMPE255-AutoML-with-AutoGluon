## üìù About the Project

Each section in the video is accompanied by a dedicated Google Colab notebook available in this repository. These notebooks demonstrate how to set up and apply AutoGluon to solve real-world AI problems, covering:

- **Tabular Classification & Regression**: Learn to handle structured data with minimal effort.
- **Text Classification**: See how to classify text using pre-trained models.
- **Image Classification**: Understand how AutoGluon can automatically handle image data.
- **Segmentation**: Explore how to perform image segmentation.
- **Semantic Matching**: Use AutoGluon to determine relationships between different entities.
- **Multi-Modal Use Cases**: Combine different data types like text and images for better model performance.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Learn to predict future values from time series data.
